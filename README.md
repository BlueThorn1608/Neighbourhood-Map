# Features
  * Clicking on the **Open** button, reveals a _Navigation Pane_, which will show all the places.
  * Additionally, you can also search for a particular place, in the **Search box**.
  * Alternatively, you can simply _click_ on the markers on the map, which will reveal more information about that place.

## Disclaimer
  * This is just a simple map of the places worth visiting, be it a quick bite or a full meal. These are in my opinion the best. There are obviously many more. :)
